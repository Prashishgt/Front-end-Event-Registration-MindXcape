    answer: `
    If you are considering working on a previously developed idea, it's important to review the Ideathon rules and guidelines to ensure that you are not violating any restrictions or guidelines. Additionally, you should consider how much of the idea you have already developed and whether it will still allow for the Ideathon's collaborative and iterative process.

    Keep in mind that the primary goal of an Ideathon is to generate new and innovative ideas, so even if you can work on a previously developed idea, it's important to approach the event with an open mind and a willingness to collaborate and generate new ideas with other participants.
